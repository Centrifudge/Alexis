# Jarvis- Your Personal Robot Butler
![JARVIS](https://github.com/virejdasani/Jarvis/blob/master/res/jarvisimg.jpg?raw=true)

Jarvis is an open source Personal Assistant that works on the command line.
Right now, in its early stages of development, it can't do much except open websites and tell you how it's doing.
The final goal for Jarvis is to do everything from sending emails to telling you a joke.

## Get Started
Clone the repo and simply run `python jarvis.py` for mac and windows or
`python3 jarvis.py` for linux.
Type the command "help" to view all commands when jarvis asks to enter command
