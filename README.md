# Jarvis- Your Robot Butler

Jarvis is an open source Personal Assistant that works on the command line.
Right now, in its early stages of developmet, it can't do much except open websites and tell you how it's doing.
The final goal for Jarvis is to do everything from send emails to telling you a joke.
