# Alexis - Your Personal Robot Butler
![Alexis](https://github.com/virejdasani/Alexis/blob/master/res/img/Alexisimg.jpg?raw=true)

Alexis is an open source Personal Assistant that works on the command line.
Right now, in its early stages of development, it can't do much except open websites, make use of Bored API, google something or pull something from Wikipedia.
The final goal for Alexis is to do everything from sending emails to telling you a joke.

## Get Started
- Check out Alexis on YouTube - https://youtu.be/LchUl9pueLw
- Clone the repo and simply run `python alexis.py` for mac and windows or
`python3 alexis.py` for linux.
- Alternatively, head to the Builds folder and open the latest version of the directory. Simply run the alexis executable by typing: `./alexis` in the terminal or cmd.
- Type the command "help" to view all commands when Alexis asks to enter command.
- Alternatively, check out our `AllCommands.txt` file.
- The default method to give commands is by typing them. However, you can type in `speak` to turn on voice recognition.

## Installation
- The modules `wikipedia` and `SpeechRecognition` are required to run Alexis.     
- To install them, run:`pip install wikipedia`, `pip install speechrecognition`.
