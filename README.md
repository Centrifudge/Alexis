# Alexis - Your Personal Robot Butler
![Alexis](https://github.com/virejdasani/Alexis/blob/master/res/img/Alexisimg.jpg?raw=true)

Alexis is an open source Personal Assistant that works on the command line.
Right now, in its early stages of development, it can't do much except open websites, make use of Bored API, google something or pull something from Wikipedia.
The final goal for Alexis is to do everything from sending emails to telling you a joke.

## Get Started
- Check out Alexis on YouTube - https://youtu.be/LchUl9pueLw
- Clone the repo and simply run `python alexis.py` for mac and windows or
`python3 alexis.py` for linux.

- Type the command "help" to view all commands when Alexis asks to enter command.
- Alternatively, check out our `AllCommands.txt` file.
- The default method to give commands is by typing them. However, you can type in `speak` to turn on voice recognition.

## Installation
- To run Alexis, you need to install some modules like this
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
